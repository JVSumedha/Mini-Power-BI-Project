I just wrapped up my very first Power BI project!ðŸš€

After learning the basics through Udemy, I challenged myself to create an end-to-end interactive report.

The data is collected from Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

ðŸ“Š Highlights of my mini project:
-> Visual, Matrix, KPI cards for transactions, profit, and returns.
-> Maps + Tree map to store locations.
-> Weekly revenue trending chart.
-> Clustered Bar Charts.
-> Filters, slicers, Measures for interactivity.
-> DAX measures, conditional formatting.

This hands-on practice exercise helped me understand how powerful Power BI can be for business insights and storytelling with data.

Super excited to dive deeper into advanced Power BI features and techniques, and to apply them on real-world datasets!ðŸš€
